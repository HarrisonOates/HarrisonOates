### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Harrison (he/him) and I'm currently studying Advanced Computing (R&D) (Hons) / Politics, Philosophy & Economics at the Australian National University!
I'm super passionate about tech policy and like to build things. Some of these are on Github, and you can check them out below.
